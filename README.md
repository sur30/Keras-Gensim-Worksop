# Keras-Gensim-Worksop
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentations. Being able to go from ideas to results with the least possible delay is a key to doing good research.

This workshop is designed for those with entry-level deep learning knowledge who are interested in knowing more about the Keras package. We will go through basic Keras structures, demonstrate a simple image classifier and discuss the applications of deep learning in the insurance industry.

Additionally, in this workshop we will also be presenting a Natural Language Processing (NLP) deep learning task using Gensim Word2Vec jointly with Keras. In order to develop mathematical models on text corpus, it is good practice to convert text into a matrix representation. Gensim is such a clean open-source Python library to handle text data. It is a very robust and efficient tool that specializes in vector space and topic modeling.

Sample codes and sample data will be provided and demonstrated with Jupyter Notebook.
